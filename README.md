# LearningGridap

This repo contains some introductory notes to learn [Gridap.jl](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl) that complement [Gridap tutorials](https://gridap.github.io/Tutorials/stable/). The target is on users having basic knowledge of Julia so very basic steps and some instructions on installation of packages in the Gridap ecosystem, the so called [plugins](https://github.com/gridap/Gridap.jl#plugins), are included. It also contains several notes and tests made while learning Gridap and it also used to learn how to admin a repo (documentation, CI, etc.).

The first step is to clone this repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/principejavier/LearningGridap
